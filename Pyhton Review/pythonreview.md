## ✍️ Leaving Notes

**Single-Line Comments**

```{python}
# This comment explains the next line of code.
print("Hello, World!") # This comment is on the same line as the code.
# This comment explains the after line of code.
```

**Multi-Line Comments**

```{pyhton}
# This is a longer comment
# that takes up
# multiple lines.
print("Multi-line comments are useful!")

'''
You can also use triple single quotes.
This is great for detailed explanations
about your code's purpose.
'''
print("Another way to comment!")
```

## 📦 Storing Information

**Rules for Naming Your "Boxes":**
* There are just a few rules to keep in mind when naming your variables:
* Start with a letter or underscore (_): my_variable is good, but 1st_variable is not.
* No special characters: Use only letters, numbers, and underscores (A-z, 0-9, _).
* Case-sensitive: my_age and My_Age are two different variables.
* No reserved words: You can't name a variable if, for, print, etc.
